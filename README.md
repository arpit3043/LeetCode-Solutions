# LeetCode-Solutions
Hi ! Arpit here
Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to as sport programmers. Competitive programming is recognized and supported by several multinational software and Internet companies, such as Google and Facebook.

A programming competition generally involves the host presenting a set of logical or mathematical problems, also known as puzzles, to the contestants (who can vary in number from tens to several thousands), and contestants are required to write computer programs capable of solving each problem. Judging is based mostly upon number of problems solved and time spent for writing successful solutions, but may also include other factors (quality of output produced, execution time, memory usage, program size, etc.)

LeetCode is the best platform to help you enhance your skills, expand your knowledge and prepare for technical interviews. LeetCode is a website where people can practice solving coding problems and prepare for technical interviews. Their main users are software engineers. LeetCode has over 1,900 questions for you to practice, covering many different programming concepts.

I will be sharing all the possible solutions either in C++, Python or in both and concepts written form with good video explaination in my blogs here.

Thanks !
